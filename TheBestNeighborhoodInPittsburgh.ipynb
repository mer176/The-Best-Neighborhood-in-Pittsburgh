    "\n",
    "##In this project, I was instructed to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by analyzing various aspects that contribute to the overall quality of life in an area. I chose three metrics to determine this: safety, traffic, and number of green spaces. I used datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to achieve this goal and gather data.\n",
    "##The Metric\n",
    "#Safety: Measured by the number of reported crimes per neighborhood.\n",
    "#Traffic: Deployed as part of traffic studies, including intersection studies, and studies covering where or whether to install speed humps.\n",
    "#Green Spaces: Measured by the number of parks and their total area in each neighborhood.\n"

    "##Conclusion\n",
    "##Based on my combined metric, I found that the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Shadyside. \n",
    "##This neighborhood scores well in safety, has numerous parks, and experiences less traffic than other neighborhoods.\n",
    "##My takeaway\n",
    "##I really enjoyed learning how data can be used to visualize an issue or overall goal. Not only was I able to find out what neighborhood \n",
    "##is the “best”, but I was able to make what were once only numbers on a spreadsheet actually make sense in terms of comparing the neighborhoods \n",
    "##against each other. Shadyside is a personal favorite of mine, so the outcome of the combined data metrics was not surprising to me. I hope to learn more about other data visualization \n",
    "##tools in the future, as this assignment proved to be a great learning experience.\n"
